# Challenge #1

**Mitigation Mastery: Decoding the dynamics of risk reduction**

**Summary**

Risk managers work tirelessly to understand and mitigate the risks in a project. They consult
with Project managers and team leaders daily to determine the likelihood and impact of risk
and what can be done to mitigate either the probability of the risk occurring , or the impact if
it does occur. But how do we know if mitigations are having the impact needed to ensure
smooth delivery?
We want teams to explore how we can measure the success of our mitigations in protecting
our baselined scope, schedule and cost? How can we ensure that we are delivering the best
mitigations possible? How can we ensure that our mitigations are having the needed effect
on scope, schedule and cost risks, and how can we ensure that successful mitigations are
taken advantage of and learned from?

**Pain Points​**

·I want to know what impact my mitigations are having on my Scope, Schedule and Cost risks
·I want to know what factors lead to a successful mitigation
·I want to know what factors lead to an unsuccessful mitigation
·I want to understand which mitigations are having the most noticeable impact
·I want to know how to build on successful mitigations
·I want to understand how we can predict if a mitigation will have an impact on reducing the
risk
·I want to understand my risk mitigation horizon - how far ahead of the potential impact of
the risk are my mitigation actions defined?



**Personas​**

As a mitigation action owner, I want to understand the impact of mitigation and how to make
my mitigations successful, So I can ensure that risks do not negatively affect my project
As a Bid Manager, I want to increase the identification of effective mitigations in the bid
phase, So I can budget for the right level of contingency funding
As a senior leader, I want to know every month that our risk management is successfully
protecting our projects, So that I can ensure that we are delivering our projects in a safe and
timely manner
As a risk owner, I want to feel confident that my risk is being mitigated from impacting in the
future, So that I can effectively deliver my project knowing identified risk is being addressed


**Business Context​**

Risk management is a core part of project delivery and central to ensuring that, given each project's
uniqueness, we can foresee what might happen and ensure that we can deliver without issue.
We want teams to explore the impact of risk mitigations. We want to know how much of an impact our
mitigations have and how we can ensure that every risk is mitigated correctly.
In order to achieve the best possible outcomes, we need to know how each risk performs. Then we
want to understand the nature of the mitigations themselves. What makes a good mitigation? How
can we spot a mitigation that may fail? How can we determine what factors drive a successful
mitigation?
Beyond that, we want to know how to support bid and project managers in mitigating risks. How can
we highlight when risk exposure are changing, or when mitigation actions are not having the desired
effect? How can we allow them to identify risks that need re-reviewing? How can we show them the
best way to mitigate a risk? How can we support them in making the right decisions at the right time?


**Dataset Description**​

For this challenge, you will be provided with a synthetic dataset created by the coalition alongside
mitigating actions taken and their free-text descriptions. You will need to analyse the impact a
mitigation has on the risk as well as use natural language machine learning to analyse the mitigations
themselves.


**Success Criteriat​**

A successful outcome would be to identify each mitigation's impact on Scope, Schedule or
Cost and the factors that contribute to it. Teams should also look to identify insight from the
mitigation itself and how best they can be used to improve mitigations and identify success.
Teams should consider time in 2 contexts
1. What does the overall data set tell us about the risk exposure and mitigation – using history
to inform the future
2.How can the data be used on an operational basis – ie flagging month on month changes (or
lack of change)
Teams should look to visualise the insight in a way that allows risk managers to make
decisions and act upon the information provided. You should always remember the goal of
delivering a project without any risks, known or unknown, being realised.
