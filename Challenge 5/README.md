# Challenge #5

**Clerk of Works Reporting**

**Summary**  
As part of a construction project, the client often appoints a clerk of works (CoW) to assist
with monitoring construction work to ensure it is carried out in accordance with scope,
quality, timelines, etc.  
This process is currently undertaken manually, with the clerk of works taking handwritten
notes while on site and updating a Word template to generate the report.
We want to automate and streamline this process from data collection to visualising the
results in a meaningful way.  

**Pain Points​**  
·I want CoWs to be able to easily collect the right data and information while on-site  
·I want data collected on-site to be stored and formatted correctly  
·I want to create reports on the site status automatically  
·I want alternate ways to visualise and communicate the data  
·I want to know what other ways this data can be used to improve reporting and
understanding of site delivery  


**Personas​**  
As a clerk of works (CoW), I want to complete repetitive forms efficiently, So that I can
ensure that data is collected accurately as soon as possible.
As a project manager, I want to gain insights from the data with minimal effort, So that I can
easily communicate the data with third parties to complement my progress reporting.
As a project manager, I want to be able to access the historical data from CoW reports, So
that I can leverage it when assessing contractor claims.  
As a client, I want to know that my construction site is progressing well in compliance with
the scope, So that I can have confidence in my contractor or intervene when necessary.
As a quantity surveyor/project manager, I want to be aware of any key issues affecting the
site, So that I can reflect within my relative scope of services.  


**Business Context​**  
To ensure that a project is being delivered to the right level of quality and scope, a client will
often appoint a Clerk of Work to visit the site and review what has been delivered. This is
generally a very manual process that concludes with filling out a form.  
However, the information collected is often incredibly relevant and useful to all parties. It
allows the client to get an unbiased view of the project and allows the main contractor to
identify important things.  
We want teams to redesign and reimagine this process. We want to begin by making the CoWs life
easier with a data collection tool and automated reporting. We want to end by expanding upon the
data collected and leveraging it to improve project quality for everyone involved greatly.  
We want teams to consider what data is being collected, how best to collect it, in what format, and
how that data can be leveraged in the future. Teams should also explore the impact of automated
reporting and how other data may be brought in to enable greater insight.  

**Dataset Description**  
For this challenge, teams will be provided a template of a CoW report and some example
entries. Teams should assume this is all the data reporting in the inspection and present a
case for how the data collected can be changed/re-formatted to create greater depth and
value without hindering the CoW when on site.  

**Success Criteria​**  
For this challenge, an ideal output would be an end-to-end solution for on-site data
collection, data storage, and automated reporting and visualisation.  
Teams should also consider how their system will notify relevant people of points of concern
and how that information is best communicated.  
Teams should also consider how this data may be leveraged more widely throughout the
project. What additional data would bring value? What does the data tell us beyond the CoWs
scope of work? How can we leverage the data for greater ROI? Teams should consider all
aspects of project delivery and how this data might feed into a more data-driven future.  

**Benefits​**  
The benefits of this challenge are primarily focused on efficiency and data management.
Creating a more efficient system to collect and store site information not only allows data to
be leveraged more easily but also encourages people to provide the best data possible (often
one of the hardest things to achieve in data analytics).  
By centralising information that is already being collected and standardising its format, we
can facilitate greater analytics and data-driven decisions and interventions.
Additionally, this challenge makes a case for more report automation and the value of
productionising automated reporting.
