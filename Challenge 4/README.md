# Challenge #4

**Demand Scenario Modelling**

**Summary**  
Heads of Planning need an efficient way to assess the impact of changes in demand on key
business metrics. This helps them:
1. Develop and validate strategies that optimise delivery and cost.
2. Forecast across the entire product portfolio using accurate assumptions and data.
3. Provide concise summaries suitable for management without requiring extensive
processing.
4. Identify risks, constraints, and opportunities for meeting cost and delivery objectives.
When summarising demand scenarios, it's essential to tailor the level of detail based on
forecast confidence and ensure that scenarios can be easily adjusted for dynamic "what if"
analysis

**Pain Points​**  
·I want to create clear, visual summaries of demand scenarios quickly.  
· I want to see cost forecasts and hours while considering factors such as commodity/vendor,
contract, control account, and capacity.  
· I need to summarise forecasted outcomes and adjust demand scenarios easily to identify
improvement opportunities.  

**Personas​**  
As a Head of Planning, I want to quickly understand changes in demand within my business
area, so that I can identify risks and constraints.
As a Head of Planning, I want to comprehend future requirements and spending across a
product portfolio, so that I can engage in informed discussions with my supply chain.
As a Head of Planning, I want to create diverse demand scenarios efficiently, so that I can
make data-driven decisions

**Business Context​**  
Effective demand scenario modelling is crucial for the business, helping optimise cost
forecasts, adjust capacity, mitigate risks, and make informed decisions. Demand forecasts
guide supply chain negotiations, load and capacity planning, and infrastructure
requirements.  
The current scenario planning process involves using SAP LTS, which mirrors the main SAP
system but operates offline. However, this process is time-consuming, detailed, and prone to
several challenges  
·Product Detail Constraints: New product introductions may not have sufficient detail, such as part
numbers, making scenario creation for the entire portfolio challenging.  
·Precision and Forecasting: High uncertainty limits the accuracy of forecasts.  
·Scenario Loading Complexity: Handling thousands of demand lines is slow and cumbersome.  
·Data Volume and Processing: The amount of data generated exceeds local tools' processing
capacities.  
·Detailed Data Summarisation: Summarising detailed data outputs is difficult and time-consuming.  

As demand scenarios become more complex, a faster and simpler solution is needed to support the
growing volume of data and ensure timely analysis.  
This challenge should be viewed from end to end. What data needs to be provided, what formulas and
forecasting methods can be used, and how can the user most easily interact with the tool?  
Teams should ensure that the user always has the right information regarding confidence and
assumptions. What data can you use to inform your forecast, and how does this effect accuracy and
reliability?  

**Dataset Description**  
Teams will be provided with an example “Footprint” for a demand scenario in Excel as loaded
into SAP (in its current state, we will take recommendations if changes would support a new
solution).  
Teams should use this data provided as an example of what is currently being used. You
should consider what data is needed to create demand scenarios and how that data can be
sourced and utilised.  
Teams will need to generate their own data to visualise and test their solution.  

**Success Criteria​**  
Teams will develop a demand scenario modelling tool that can:
1. Generate summary reports and visualisations on-demand.
2. Allow users to update assumptions, load new data, and edit scenarios quickly and easily.
3. Capture key attributes like cost, delivery footprint, factory hours, and volume for each
scenario.
4. Filter scenarios based on commodity, control account, program, and capacity.
5. Enable scenario creation using a ‘footprint’ methodology, even with limited information.
6. Compare outcomes across scenarios and highlight optimisation opportunities to adjust
constraints.
7. Display changes and trends over time with multi-user access to the summary.
An additional feature could include optimisation capabilities that suggest improved demand
scenarios for better efficiency.

**Benefits​**  
This solution will streamline demand scenario modelling, allowing Heads of Planning to make
better-informed decisions. It will reduce the time needed for high-level analysis, enabling
more focus on validation, optimisation, and strategic discussions with suppliers.
Additionally, it will support portfolio shaping by more efficiently aligning demand scenarios
with business priorities
