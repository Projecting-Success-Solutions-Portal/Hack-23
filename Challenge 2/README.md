# Challenge #1

**Coalition Assurance Group - 3 part challenge**

1.  **Part A: Insights from Third Line Assurance**
This challenge focuses on extracting trends and recurring issues from Integrated Assurance
Gate Review reports using natural language processing. The aim is to provide senior leaders
with actionable insights, helping them make informed decisions to intervene in projects more
effectively.
2.  **Part B: Anticipating Assurance Challenges and Lessons in Major Projects**
Here, participants are tasked with analysing past assurance reviews and lessons learned to
identify key themes and leading indicators that can help foresee project challenges before
they escalate. By anticipating potential issues, this challenge aims to shift assurance
activities from reactive to proactive, significantly moving the dial on project delivery.
3.  **Part C: Dynamic Assurance Review – Context-Aware Tools for Major Projects and Portfolios**
This challenge invites teams to consider ‘horizon three’ of the vision to reimagine assurance.
The aim is to develop tools that dynamically adapt assurance based on a project’s unique
context, phase, and risks. The goal is to automate readiness checks, such as verifying the
completeness of business cases or plans, and then use diagnostic and predictive analytics,
respectively, to guide assurance reviewers toward any blind spots to current issues and the
most critical risks that the project is most predisposed to.


**Part A: Insights from Third Line Assurance

**Challenge Sponsor**
UK Ministry of Defence

**Summary**
Assurance oversight on projects is vital to ensuring that senior leaders are adequately
informed about project activities. With the right information, senior leaders can step in and
support the right areas in a project and provide the right weight behind their voices to solve
problems.
We want teams to explore Integrated Assurance Gate Review reports and use natural
language processing to identify trends and highlight areas of repeat concern. With a wealth
of reports stored in a backlog, what insight can organisations act on to improve delivery
across the board? How must an organisation capitalise on the audit work done throughout
the years?

**Pain Points​**
·  I want to know how to present information in assurance review reports so that senior
  leaders are empowered to make the right decisions
·  I want to understand what assurance reports are telling us about our processes and
practices beyond the review team recommendation categories
·  I want to know how to capitalise on historical data around assurance
·  I want to streamline the assurance and intervention process
·  I want to feel confident in how we intervene in projects
·  I want to know when I can feel confident that a project can progress without intervention
·  I want to understand the future of project assurance and what assurance teams must do to
  improve project delivery and support a data-driven future

**Personas​**
As an SRO (Senior Responsible Owner), I want to understand what the assurance reports are
telling me, So I can make the right decisions and ensure the right people are informed
As a Review team member, I want to have confidence in what we are reporting about our
assurance and understand all relevant insight, including confidence that current IPA review
recommendation categories and sub-categories are sufficiently detailed, So that we can
ensure that appropriate action is taken in order to support the best delivery of projects
As a project/programme manager, I want to smoothly move through the assurance process and gain
the vital support I need in the right areas, So that I can deliver my project effectively and with the
proper support
As a key decision-maker, I want to know the current state of my projects/programmes and where
intervention is needed, So that I can be confident in my interventions

**Business Context​**
Each year (and/or ahead of key decision points), major infrastructure projects and programmes in the
UK receive a third-line assurance review organised by the IPA or a delegated body (within MOD, this is
the Defence Integrated Assurance Hub). The outcome of this review is a report on the
project/programme's current state and areas of concern. Once drafted by the review team lead, this
report is then finalised in conjunction with the SRO (Senior Responsible Owner) to enable them to
make key project interventions.
This third line of assurance activity covers all aspects of an organisation's risk management
framework, including Risk identification, Risk assessment and response, and Communication of riskrelated information. 
The reports provided to organisations cover a wide view of the project as a whole
and further explore highlighted areas of concern and potential concern.
We want teams to analyse these assurance review reports to understand how best the information
can be delivered and acted upon and what insight can be gleaned from natural language processing
of the reports. With all high value projects and programmes receiving a review each year, there are
likely to be reoccurring themes and information that may not be identified by simply reading them or
by a review of recommendation categories alone.
Teams should keep in mind that the purpose of assurance is to give confidence in the state of the
project and empower leaders to intervene where necessary. It would help if you considered how to
smoothly deliver the information in the reports to the internal teams and how best to visualise insight
to allow action

**Dataset Description**​
Teams will be provided with two sanitised third-line assurance reports, significantly
anonymised due to the sensitive nature of assurance reports. In addition, teams will receive
several synthetic reports generated to support your analysis.
It will be difficult for teams to identify insight from the provided reports. You should consider
what a system would look like if you had access to unaltered reports and what would be
needed to glean the most insight.

**Success Criteria**
A successful outcome would be visualising the information in each report and linking it to the
review recommendations. An output that allows organisations to ingest their reports and
provide insight without significant additional development would be ideal.
Teams should also remember that an output showing no additional insight is still helpful
information. Many organisations would greatly appreciate the reassurance that they correctly
approach a problem.

**Benefits​**
By understanding the impact of our mitigations, we can ensure that the right actions are taken to ensure
our projects' timely and effective delivery. With a deeper understanding of risk, we can move towards a
future that is less reactive and more proactive, reimagining how risk management is done and using data to
ensure that our projects are elevated to a new meaning of success.

**Part B: Anticipating Assurance Challenges and Lessons in Major Projects**

**Challenge Sponsor**
Rolls Royce and Projecting Success

**Summary**
Assurance gateway reviews of major projects often identify recurring issues and lessons
learned that, if anticipated earlier, could prevent costly delays and failures. This challenge
invites participants to analyse a corpus of documentation to:
·Extract key themes and lessons from assurance reviews and lessons learned reports.
·Identify leading indicators to foresee these problems in advance and mitigate them.
·Develop tools that anticipate assurance gaps dynamically, based on the project phase,
documentation status, and risks.
By transforming retrospective lessons into proactive insights, this challenge aims to improve
the delivery and governance of major projects by identifying potential issues before they
escalate.

**Objectives**
*Key Theme and Context Extraction*: Analyse lessons learned documents, NAO reports and
similar, to extract key themes, common issues and understand the context.
*Recommender system*: Create a system, or a part of a system, to advise project
professionals on which lessons learned are relevant to their project, with an understanding
of the potential implications. Which projects, work packages, functions are predisposed to
specific lessons, taking into account the context.
We also need to bring the lessons to life, by referencing and summarising source material;
think how we could link this to storytelling and nudge theory.
*Visualisation*: Having developed the recommender system, how would you visualise them?
An example could be a relevance function based on context vs potential impact or
consequence. The highly relevant, high impact lessons get reviewed first.
*Minority report*: Imagine you are Tom Cruise in the Minority Report film. You want to present
this information to your board as an independent advisor. If people are going to ignore the
lessons this may be regarded as a ‘pre-crime’. Enable them to fast forward and reverse
through time to understand what is likely to emerge and when.
*Leading Indicator Identification*: Based on some of the themes extracted, identify potential
probes (or leading indicators) that could help to sense or predict future issues. For example,
missing documentation, PDRI maturity assessments or missing risks may act as early warning
signs of potential project challenges.
*Tool Development (Optional)*: If time allows, teams can develop a tool to automate the
identification of leading indicators, offering real-time insights into potential project risks and
assurance gaps. This could involve tracking critical documents or setting up dashboards to
visualise evolving risks

**Pain Points**
*One-size-fits-all Approach*: Traditional assurance reviews often use a standard checklist
that may not account for the project’s phase, complexity, or specific risk factors.
*Reactive Learning*: Many lessons are learned only after issues arise, rather than identifying
early warning signs and acting proactively to prevent them.
*Lessons Learned*: The process tends to degenerate into a box ticking process. How can we
turn this around to adding value and anticipating the pothole way in advance, then avoiding it.

**Personas**
*Assurance Review Team Member*: Needs to dynamically focus on key areas of concern
based on a rich corpus of project document, ensuring they highlight issues early in the
process.
*Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)*: Wants confidence that the team are taking appropriate
action to avoid the avoidable. Also ensure that the assurance process is focusing on potential
problem areas before they cause project delays, allowing timely intervention.
*Programme/Project Manager*: Desires proactive insights to mitigate potential variance
events before they escalate, ensuring that governance and project delivery align with
expectations.

**Dataset Description**
Participants will receive:
*Lessons learned*: Including publicly available documentation from around the world, plus
information from the FOI process on lessons learned or outputs from assurance reports.
*Synthetic documentation*: Generated by the Projecting Success team on demand to support
your proof of concept.

**Success Criteria**
·An MVP that tackles part of this challenge and moves the dial on how we leverage lessons
learned and assurance review data to ‘avoid the avoidable’.
·Demonstrate an effective understanding of the problem statement via a problem
decomposition.
·A high level architecture of how your MVP fits in with the broader picture. i.e. which part of
the puzzle are you solving. Document any assumptions

**Business Context**
There are 1000s of lessons learned and insights from assurance reviews from across the
profession. But, as a community we struggle to leverage them and keep making the same
mistakes time and time again. In an era of advanced data and AI we are convinced that we
can change this.

**Benefit**
Saving $trillions in avoiding the avoidable on future projects.

Notes:
Note 1: Challenge A is focused around extracting themes, or topics, from assurance reports. In simple
terms, Challenge B is about understanding which potholes the project is likely to encounter, how deep
they are (a slight delay or a catastrophic delay) and to navigate a way around them. However, if you were
driving from London to Nottingham, you wouldn’t be interested in the potholes in Cornwall, so the
information on the potholes needs to be context specific.
Note 2: It is very easy for project professionals to ignore these lessons. They may believe that they don’t
apply because this time is different, recency bias, gamblers fallacy etc. The insights are inconvenient
etc. So how do you persuade people to review them appropriately?
Also, they may choose to disregard them because they don’t believe the impact will be that significant.
Back to the pothole analogy – if someone got a flat tyre from the pothole they may be concerned, if they
wrote off their car they would be very concerned, if the pothole created a series of accidents where
people died they would be compelled to act. How do we influence decision making?
Note 3: Some of the lessons learned are a failure to follow process, which links to Part C. But asking
people to follow process is likely to degenerate into background noise. But some of the lessons are very
specific, such as a specific integration issue which was missed. It may be helpful for you to segment or
classify the lessons on this basis. Think of some of the other factors that may be applicable, such as was
it foreseeable and avoidable or an act of god and difficult to anticipate?
Note 4: This challenge has a broad scope and you won’t solve it all. Ensure you focus on ‘the rope of
scope’ and as a team agree which parts you will tackle. Work with the Projecting Success team to test
out your ideas before you spend too long on them to reduce the number of dead ends that you explore.

**Part C: Dynamic Assurance Review: Context-Aware Tools for Major Projects and Portfolios**

**Challenge Sponsor**
Major Projects Association and Projecting Success

**Summary**
This challenge invites teams to consider ‘horizon three’ of the vision to reimagine assurance.
The aim is to develop tools that dynamically adapt assurance based on a project’s unique
context, stage, and risks. Major project and portfolio assurance reviews are essential to
ensuring objectives are met, risks are managed, and benefits are realised. Traditional gate
reviews can be prescriptive and may not fully account for the complexity, context, or
evolving nature of the project or portfolio. They may be blind to underlying issues or fail to
spot emerging risks because the assurance review is focusing elsewhere.
This challenge invites participants to create tools that:
·Automate the verification of critical documents such as business cases, registers and plans
and dynamically adapt the review process based on the project’s unique characteristics and
readiness for the next stage of work [diagnostic analytics]
·Help guide assurance reviewers toward the most critical risks that the project is most
predisposed to [predictive analytics]

**Objectives**
·*Leverage Existing Assurance Guidance*: Use documents like the Assurance Toolkit,
Gateway Reviews, and the Project Routemap to structure assurance reviews dynamically.
These should be flexible enough to adapt to different phases of a project and accommodate
specific governance needs.
·*Automated Document Verification*: Develop scripts or automation to verify that essential
project and portfolio records and documentation (such as the business case, Integrated
Assurance and Approval Plan (IAAP), risk registers, and benefit plans) are up-to-date,
complete, and aligned with the project’s goals.
·*Contextual Review Adaptation*: Create solutions that adjust the focus of assurance reviews
based on the project’s phase, complexity, and gaps in the current readiness for the gate and
the next stage of work. For example, the tool could detect if the business case needs
updating, if there are unfilled roles/posts, or if risks have not been adequately documented
at key decision points.
·*Prioritised Focus Areas*: Use appropriate NAO lessons learned reports and the six crosscutting
themes from the Project Route map (see below) to identify the projects predisposition to critical 
risks and then dynamically guide assurance teams towards those areas.

**Cross-Cutting Themes and Assurance Areas**
·Tools created should help the assurance team focus on these areas:

**Project Assurance Themes**
·*Benefits and Outcomes Focus*: Ensure alignment with long-term outcomes and track
benefit realisation.
·*People and Skills*: Assess capacity and skills, ensuring the right people are in place.
·*Behaviour and Culture*: Review whether the desired behaviours are embedded and whether
the culture enables success.
·*Economic, Environmental, and Social Value*: Consider the broader impact of the project
and align with sustainability and social responsibility goals.
·*Digital and Technology*: Ensure modern digital methods and tools are embedded from the
outset to maximise efficiency.
·*Transitions*: Evaluate plans for transitions between phases and whether governance
structures will adapt effectively.

**Portfolio-Level Assurance Areas**
·*Strategic Alignment*: Review alignment with corporate strategy and ensure that
governance evolves as the portfolio changes.
·*Risk and Performance Management*: Confirm that risks are managed dynamically across
the portfolio and that performance metrics are in place.
·*Governance and Capability*: Assess whether governance is robust and adaptive to support
long-term success

**Personas**
·*Assurance Review Team Member*: Needs guidance on which areas of a project or portfolio
to prioritise, based on risks, gaps in documentation, and evolving governance structures.
·*Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)*: Requires assurance that key areas of risk and
misalignment are identified early, allowing for proactive intervention.
·*Portfolio Manager*: Seeks to ensure that the portfolio delivers its intended outcomes, while
managing interdependencies and adjusting governance as needed.

**Dataset Description**
·Participants will be provided with:
·Assurance Guidance: Documents such as the Assurance Toolkit, Gateway Review Guides,
and Project Routemap.
·Sample Project and Portfolio Documentation: Including business cases, IAAPs, risk registers,
benefits realisation plans, and project delivery schedules, covering various stages of the
project lifecycle.

**Success Criteria**
··Context-Aware Assurance: Solutions should dynamically adjust the assurance review based
on the project’s stage, available documentation, and current risks.
·Automated Evidence Checking: Teams should create scripts that automatically check the
presence and accuracy of key documents like business cases, ensuring compliance with
assurance standards.
·Predictive Prioritisation: Based on the cross-cutting themes and portfolio assurance criteria,
the solution should guide the assurance team to focus on the most critical areas that are
likely to have the greatest impact on the project or portfolio.

**Business Context**
Assurance reviews often follow a process that may not fully account for the unique context
of a project or portfolio. The goal of this challenge is to develop dynamic tools that can tailor
the review process, focus on high-risk areas, and automate document or assurance criteria
verification. By incorporating cross-cutting themes and comprehensive guidance documents
like the Assurance Toolkit and Gateway Reviews, this challenge aims to create more
proactive and responsive assurance mechanisms.
This will ultimately improve governance, reduce project and portfolio risk, and ensure that the
benefits are realised efficiently.

**Benefit**
This challenge will:
·Improve Efficiency: By guiding assurance teams to the highest-priority areas, the process
will save time and improve review accuracy.
·Enhance Compliance: Automated document checks will ensure all critical documents, such
as business cases and risk registers, are up-to-date and compliant with assurance standards.
·Foster Proactive Governance: Tools will help project teams adapt governance structures
dynamically to reflect evolving project risks and needs.
